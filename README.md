# Data Visualization Project

This project showcases various data visualization techniques using Python and popular libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. It demonstrates how to represent data in an intuitive and visually appealing way, making it easier to analyze and understand trends, patterns, and outliers.

## Features

- **Variety of Charts**: Includes bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pie charts, heatmaps, and more.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Use of Plotly for dynamic and interactive charts.
- **Customizable Visualizations**: Modify styles, colors, and data inputs for tailored visual representations.
- **Real-world Examples**: Demonstrations with real datasets (e.g., financial data, population data, or custom datasets).
